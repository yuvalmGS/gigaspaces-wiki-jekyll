To get started with GigaSpaces C++ API:

1. If you're not yet familiar with GigaSpaces space-based C++ API, it is recommended to get started with the [CPP API Hello World Example](./cpp-api-hello-world-example.html). In this example, you will learn how to use GigaSpaces main concepts and how to work with the space.
1. After you've learnt a bit about the space-based C++ API and Gigaspaces main concepts, you can now move to the [GigaSpaces CPP Processing Unit Example](./gigaspaces-cpp-processing-unit-example.html) , where you'll learn more advanced GigaSpaces concepts and build your SBA application using the C++ Processing Unit.
1. Other scenarios:
    - [Writing Existing CPP Class to Space](./writing-existing-cpp-class-to-space.html) -- learn how to save existing C++ classes in the space.
    - [CPP Type Converter](./cpp-type-converter.html) -- learn how to to work with data types that aren't supported by the GigaSpaces C++ API.

# Overview

GigaSpaces C++ applications may use the [CPP Processing Unit](./cpp-processing-unit.html), which utilize the concept of Space-Based Architecture (SBA) by allowing simple development, packaging and deployment of application services together with middleware services.

![cpp-SBA-system-archi.jpg](/attachment_files/cpp-SBA-system-archi.jpg)

The C++ Processing Unit runs as an independent service, allowing you to distribute and parallelize your processing on several machines, thus achieving higher performance, lower latency, and scalability.
