The polling event container is an implementation of the polling consumer pattern which uses the Space to receive events.
A polling event operation is mainly used when simulating Queue semantics or when using the master-worker design pattern.

The polling event container.

- [Concurrent consumers](./polling-container-scaling.html){%wbr%}
By default, the polling event container starts a single thread that performs the receive operations, and invokes the event listener. It can be configured to start several concurrent consumer threads.

- [Transaction support](./polling-container-transactions.html){%wbr%}
Both the receive operation and the actual event action can be configured to be performed under a transaction.
